Scope: Help prospects (potential customer) find shortlist of candidates & statistics based on their profile. Help recruiters use Jobful by crawling job description pages and pushing back shortlists of candidates.

Deployment for production: To be pushed to Microsoft Azure instance with private connection to Jobful platform.

Future development: Lead generation robot for crawling other job boards and sending overview of potential candidates on Jobful.
